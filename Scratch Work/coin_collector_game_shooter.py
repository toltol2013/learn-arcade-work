"""
This adapts the previous static coin collector game by the player shooting bullets to destroy the coins
The main changes to the code are as follows:
1. we create a 3rd sprite list to handle the bullets
2. the mouse movement function is changed so the player can only move left/right
3. a new mouse click function creates a bullet when the mouse is clicked, positions it, and adds it to the
   bullet sprite list
4. the window class update function has a new loop added - this loops through the bullet list and checks if
   the bullet has hit a coin, if so the bullet and coin are removed and the score increased. Also, if the
   bullet has moved off the top of the screen the bullet is removed.
